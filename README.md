Flash projects I created while in high school


In order to demo each project:
- Download the folder and run the .swf file
- If you have Flash installed this should open in a Flash Player window.
- If you don't this should open in your web browser. (This may cause some display issues.)
- In order to fix these display issues, resize your browser window to 550px x 400px

In order to look at the source code for each project:
- The source code for Flash projects are stored in .as files
- The main source code file will be the one with the same name as the .swf file

In order to view graphics and objects on the stage:
- You will need to open the .fla file with Adobe Flash
